ðŸ”¹ Algorithm (Using Monotonic Stack)

Weâ€™ll use a monotonic decreasing stack that stores indices.

Steps:

Iterate from right to left.

While stack not empty and arr[stack.top()] <= arr[i], pop the stack.

If stack not empty â†’ top of stack is the next greater element.

Push current index i onto stack.
