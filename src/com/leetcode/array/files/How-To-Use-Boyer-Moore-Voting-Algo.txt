⚙️ Approach 2 — Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm (Optimal ✅)

This is the most efficient and elegant solution —
O(n) time and O(1) space, used in top interviews.

💡 Intuition

If we pair up different elements, the majority element will remain at the end.

Maintain a candidate and a count.

Traverse array:

If count == 0, pick current element as new candidate.

If element == candidate → count++

Else → count--

At the end, the candidate is the majority element.
